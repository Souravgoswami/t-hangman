##  How to Get T-Hangman Running 🏃
+ Download the wordlist and the Ruby script*. Keep them together.
+ Run the Ruby script with Ruby 2.6.0+ or make it executable and the #! line will use /usr/bin/ruby path.

\* *T-Hangman is currently 3.0 - which has emoji. If your terminal doesn't support emoji, please use the older version which is no longer supported.*

## How to Play 🎮
- You will be asked random English words. You have to guess them right.

- If you typed 10 wrong letters, you will lose the game.

- If you typed the correct word, t-hangman will dance!

- Good luck!!
