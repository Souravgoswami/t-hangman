##  How to Get T-Hangman Running 🏃
+ Download the wordlist and the Ruby script*. Keep them together.
+ Run the Ruby script with Ruby 2.6.0+ or make it executable and the #! line will use /usr/bin/ruby path.

\* *T-Hangman is currently 3.0 - which has emoji. If your terminal doesn't support emoji, please use the older version which is no longer supported.*

## Installation (Debian systems only):
+ Download the deb file ![here](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/t-hangman/blob/master/Debian/t-hangman-v3.0.deb?raw=true)
* If you have **GDebi GTK** you can open the deb file with GDebi GTK and click on the Install package button give sudo password if you launched GDebi GTK without any root privilege. You can verify what's going to be installed.

* If you **don't have GDebi GTK**, you can use `sudo gdebi <filename>` or use `sudo dpkg -i <filename>`. The file name will be t-hangman-v{version}.deb.

## How to Play 🎮
- You will be asked random English words. You have to guess them right 😎

- If you typed the correct word, t-hangman will dance 🕺

- T-Hangman is always pessimist. He will hung himself if you've typed 10 wrong letters 😱

- Typing wrong letters will reduce your $$ Coins. If your coins get to 0, you have to restart the game 😰

- Good luck!!
